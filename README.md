FactoryIO Pick&Place XYZ solution by RsLogix5000. 

I changed original scene a bit. Exit conveyor entry and exit sensors have been put. I added scene file if you want to try at your computer. 

In original video published by FactoryIO, they put 3 parts on boxes. I decided to put 6. 

I don't think I am going to solve this scene using another plc brand. 

Here is the video below:
